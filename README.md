# IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF)

It internally deploys an AI-inspired Energy-Planner (EP) algorithm that exploits domain-specific operators to balance the trade-off between convenience and energy consumption in
satisfying the Rule Automation Workflows (RAW) pipelines of users. 

IoT Meta-Control Firewall has been developed by researchers and students at the Data Management Systems Laboratory (DMSL), Department of Computer Science at the University of Cyprus.

### Preface
The IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF) is an innovative system architecture and application, which internally deploys an AI-inspired Energy-Planner algorithm that exploits domain-specific operators to balance the trade-off between convenience/comfort and energy consumption while managing RAW pipelines of users. IMCF filters the RAW pipelines in a way that these do not collide with the long-term objectives of users (like a network firewall).

## Components 

Short description of the contents included in this release.

### Java
The Source code for the IMCF Java library. Lead Developer: Soteris Constantinou. 

### Web (Laravel)
The Source code for the IMCF Laravel PHP web framework following the
model–view–controller architectural pattern. Lead Developer: Soteris Constantinou. 

### Datasets
Anonymized measurements from a real residential apartment that comprises of a variety of sensors, submeters and readings. These
are real datasets of residential data collected by the “Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems” (CASAS) at Washington State University (http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/). CASAS serves to meet research needs around testing of the technologies using real data through the use of a smart
homes environment located on the WSU Pullman campus.
The real weather forecast dataset was acquired using Weather API on the OpenWeatherMap website and contains ∼ 5 years (2012-2017) of high temporal resolution data based on hourly measurements of various weather attributes, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, weather description, wind direction and speed (https://openweathermap.org/api).
