# IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF)

It internally deploys an AI-inspired Energy-Planner (EP) algorithm that exploits domain-specific operators to balance the trade-off between convenience and energy consumption in
satisfying the Rule Automation Workflows (RAW) pipelines of users. 

IoT Meta-Control Firewall has been developed by researchers and students at the Data Management Systems Laboratory (DMSL), Department of Computer Science at the University of Cyprus.

### Preface
The IoT Meta-Control Firewall (IMCF) is an innovative system architecture and application, which internally deploys an AI-inspired Energy-Planner algorithm that exploits domain-specific operators to balance the trade-off between convenience/comfort and energy consumption while managing RAW pipelines of users. IMCF filters the RAW pipelines in a way that these do not collide with the long-term objectives of users (like a network firewall).
